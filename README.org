Extension to ox-jekyll for better export of subtrees. This is only possible
thanks to =ox-jekyll=, from the [[https://github.com/yoshinari-nomura/org-octopress][org-octopress]] repo (a copy is provided in this
repo).

*Please note, this is not a package, this is a script. Feel free to
 submit issues if you run into problems, just be aware that this does
 not fully conform with usual package standards.*

** Usage

Place this in your ~load-path~, add the following lines to your init file, and
invoke ~M-x endless/export-to-blog~ to export a subtree as a blog post.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(autoload 'endless/export-to-blog "jekyll-once")
(setq org-jekyll-use-src-plugin t)

;; Obviously, these two need to be changed for your blog.
(setq endless/blog-base-url "http://endlessparentheses.com/")
(setq endless/blog-dir (expand-file-name "~/Git-Projects/blog/"))
#+end_src
